# web3

Addson's web3 Projects.

## A Bitcoin Prototype

The main goal of this project is to create a prototype of a Bitcoin network, including all the key concepts like blocks, transactions, UTXO, mempool, miner, and wallet. The aim is to simulate these concepts for learning purposes, rather than making a professional application. But don't worry, it works well as a practical learning tool to understand not only how Bitcoin mining works but also the main ideas behind the Bitcoin network. So, I invite you to try it out... It's definitely worth it!
